# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my practice work on data structures and algorithms. I am working to complete an online course focused on implementing various algorithms and data structures in both C and C++. To further solidify my understanding, I have translated these same problems into Swift, demonstrating adaptability and proficiency in multiple programming languages.

## Contents

- **C & C++ Implementations**: A detailed exploration of various data structures and algorithms using C and C++. The implementations include thorough explanations, efficient code, and consideration of edge cases.
- **Swift Implementations**: Once finished the the C/C++ implementations, translations of the same problems into Swift will be made, showcasing my ability to work across different programming paradigms and my commitment to continuous learning.

## Highlights

- **Multi-Language Proficiency**: Implementations in C, C++, and Swift, reflecting a versatile skill set.
- **Efficiency**: Emphasis on optimal time and space complexity across all implementations.
- **Problem Solving**: A wide spectrum of problems solved, from foundational to advanced concepts.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-structured code, following industry best practices, with comprehensive comments.
