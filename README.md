# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my practice work on data structures and algorithms. I have completed a comprehensive online course that focused on implementing various algorithms and data structures in the C programming language. To further hone my skills, I have translated these same problems into Swift, demonstrating my ability to adapt and learn across different programming paradigms.

## Contents

- **C Implementations**: A thorough exploration of various data structures and algorithms using C. It includes detailed explanations, efficient code, and consideration of edge cases.
- **Swift Implementations**: Translations of the same problems into Swift, showcasing not only my understanding of the algorithms but also my ability to work in different programming languages.

## Highlights

- **Efficiency**: Careful consideration of time and space complexity in both C and Swift implementations.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling a wide range of problems from basic to advanced levels.
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured code, following best practices, with extensive comments explaining logic and decisions.
- **Adaptation Across Languages**: Demonstrating flexibility in coding by solving the same problems in both C and Swift.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository to your local machine to explore the code. The C and Swift code are organized into separate directories for clarity.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DSA.git
