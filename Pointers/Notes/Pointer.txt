Pointers are used to access data indirectly.

main program can directly access main memory and stack
main program can not directly access the heap.
In order to access memory on the heap, we need a pointer.
Pointers are used to access resources outside of the program, accessing heap memory, and parameter passing.

Example:

int a = 10; //data variable

int *p; // address variable
p = &a; // created in the stack frame of the main function.

lets say a is stored at location 200-201.
p is stored at some other location, 210-211.
the value of p, which is located at 210-211 is the memory location of a, which is 200-201.
p points at the memory location of a.

printf("%d",a); //prints 10
printf("%d",*p); //prints 10, this is data printing


//in order to use malloc, import std.h

#include<stdlib.h>
int main(){
	//This uses c
	int *p;
	p = (int *) malloc(5* sizeof(int)); //if int is 2 bytes, we are allocated 5*2, or 10, bytes of memory, this is allocated on the heap
	
	//allocating to the heap using c++
	p = new int[5];
	
	

	
	
	return 0;
}
