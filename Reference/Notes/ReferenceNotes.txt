Reference:


int main(){

	int a = 10;
	
	// we want a reference to a
	int &r = a;
	
	//what this does:
	
	//if you want to reference the value 10, you call either use r or a. they both have the value 10.
	//2 names for a varirable
	
	cout<<a; // 10
	r++;
	cout<<a; // 11
	cout<r; //11
	
	//this is useful in parameter passing
	//r is considered an alias
	

	return 0;
